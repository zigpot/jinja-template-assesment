The goal is to recreate the existing figma design as a Jinja2 template wihtin time limit.

to run (assuming Jinja is installed):
```
jinja tbr.j2 -d data.json > tbr.html # Windows
```

```
jinjax tbr.j2 data.json > tbr.html # Mac/Linux
```

LLM AI assistant was frequently used for:
1. refreshing knowledge on templateing.
2. code review, especially in regard to best practice.
3. code suggestion (IDE built-in).
4. generating exemplatory parts e.g. data json placeholders.

This a 2 hours assesment, done intermittently.

Thank you
